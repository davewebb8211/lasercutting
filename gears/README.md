Extension for Inkscape to generate involute gears for lasercutting 
==================================================================

These are 'real' involute gears from a mechanical engineer ;-)

I was not satisfied with the 'artistic' gears that can be generated with Inkscape so I was trying to make it better. 

The generated gears confirm to ISO 53 / DIN 867 (Basic rack for involute teeth of cylindrical gears for general engineering and heavy engineering'). Sadly, this document is not freely available. 

Check it out at Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute_gear

This is how it would look like:

Usage
-----

Copy gears_evolvente.inx and gears_evolvente.py to your Inkscape extension directory 

This could be
  /Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/extensions/
on OS X. 

Then start Inkscape and you'll find a new entry in Extensions -> Render. 

Good luck with lasercutting your own gears!

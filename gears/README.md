Extension for Inkscape to generate involute gears for lasercutting 
==================================================================

These are 'real' involute gears from a mechanical engineer ;-)
They confirm to ISO 53 / DIN 867 (Basic rack for involute teeth of cylindrical gears for general engineering and heavy engineering'). Sadly, this document is not freely available. 

Check it out at Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute_gear

== Usage ==

Copy gears_evolvente.inx and gears_evolvente.py to your Inkscape extension directory 

This could be
  /Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/extensions/
on OS X.

Extension for Inkscape to generate pulleys for timing belts for lasercutting 
==================================================================

I'm trying to generate pulleys for timing belts with Inkscape. This is work-in-progress. 

The generated pulleys should confirm to DIN 7721 ('Synchronous belt drives, metric pitch, tooth space profile of synchronous pulleys'). Sadly, this document is not freely available. 
Usage
-----

Copy gears_evolvente.inx and gears_evolvente.py to your Inkscape extension directory 

This could be
  /Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/extensions/
on OS X. 

Then start Inkscape and you'll find a new entry in Extensions -> Render. 

Good luck with lasercutting your own gears!
